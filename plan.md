# Serene Reading Platform - Refined Plan

## 🎯 Vision
A peaceful reading sanctuary where users upload any content (articles, PDFs, books) and get beautifully formatted, distraction-free reading experiences with intelligent annotations.

## 📊 System Architecture

```
Upload → OCR/LLM Processing → Backend Formatting → Beautiful Rendering
   ↓
Persistent Storage ← → Real-time Annotations ← → AI Explanations
```

## 1. **Content Processing Pipeline**

### Input Sources
- PDF files (books, papers, documents)
- Images (screenshots, scanned pages)
- URLs (articles, blog posts)
- Direct text paste
- EPUB/MOBI files (future)

### Processing Flow
1. **Extraction** - Pull raw content from source
2. **OCR/LLM API** - Send to vision/parsing service for intelligent extraction
3. **Structured Output** - Receive clean Markdown with proper hierarchy
4. **Backend Enhancement** - Format, add IDs, extract metadata, generate TOC
5. **Storage** - Save processed content with reading statistics
6. **Rendering** - Display in custom reading UI

### Recommended OCR/LLM Services
- **GPT-4 Vision** - Best for mixed content (text + images)
- **Claude 3 Opus** - Excellent for long documents
- **LlamaParse** - Specialized PDF parsing with structure preservation
- **Mathpix** - Academic papers with equations
- **Unstructured.io** - Multi-format document processing

### Processing Intelligence
- Detect title, author, publication date
- Extract section hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Clean formatting (remove ads, navigation, footers)
- Preserve important elements (quotes, code blocks, lists)
- Calculate reading time and word count
- Generate table of contents

---

## 2. **Database Schema**

### Core Tables

**Articles/Books**
- Basic info (title, author, source type/URL)
- Content (markdown, processed HTML)
- Metadata (reading time, word count, language, tags)
- Media (cover image, extracted images)
- Processing status (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- User ownership

**Annotations**
- Type (note, highlight, AI explanation)
- Selected text and position data
- Content (user notes, AI responses)
- Visual positioning (coordinates for rendering)
- Article and user references

**Reading Progress**
- Current position (scroll, paragraph)
- Percentage completed
- Reading history and time spent
- Last read timestamp

**Users**
- Authentication details
- Subscription tier (free/premium)
- AI credits/quota
- Preferences (font, theme, settings)

**Collections** (optional)
- User-created folders
- Article groupings
- Sharing permissions

- **Cost Management** - Rate limiting, quota system, response caching

### Processing Prompts
- Content extraction and structuring
- Metadata generation
- Key point identification
- Translation and summarization
